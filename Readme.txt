STOCK PATTERN CHARTING USING REMOTE API:
---------------------------------------------------------------

I need to have a stock pattern charting with the output as in attached excel file.
1/ when I enter the stock symbol (ie.WMT) in cell B1 then the VBA program will
2/ Put the symbol name in cell A3
3/ Get the information from a data provider (ie. Rapidapi.com) to chart cols B3 thru L3
       (for !D, 5D, 1W, 1M, 3M, 6M, YTD, 1Y, 2Y 5Y, MAX)
4/ Step 1/, 2/ and 3/ will repeat for other stock symbols in additional rows
===========================================
For testing:
You can go to raidapi.com
Create a free personal account   (no need  to enter Company info)
                                                          (you will get 500 api requests for testing)
Login
Select API MARKET PLACE      (at top)
Select DEVELOPERS                    (in middle)
Select YAHOO FINANCE big square icon  (on right)
Select Finance again                 (to confirm)/optional
